# PA4 Subnet Addressing in Mininet
CST 311 Team Programming Assignment #4

**The Objectives for this assignment are:**

- to create a network described in the paragraph below using the program MiniEdit; 

- modify the initial Python script generated by MiniEdit so that hosts in different networks can send packets to each other; 

- modify the Python script so that one of the hosts (h2) runs a TLS-enabled simple web server; 

- modify the Python script so that one of the hosts (h4) runs the chat server your team developed in Programming Assignment (PA) #3;

- modify the Python script so that chat client program your team developed in PA #3 runs on both client hosts (h1 and h3).

- off-line in a separate script (Python or bash) create a Certificate Authority and issue a TLS server certificate that will be bound to the web server on h2, using Lab 6 as a guide. The script should request the server common name (CN), such as www.webpa4.test as input, and issue the certificate for that CN.  (Remember you must modify the local hosts file to include that name and IP address in Task [3].)
